# Magic-Eye
This is a matlab code that creates Single-Image-Stereogram for a topographic image (e.g. binary, but can also have multiple intensity levels like m√∂biusband.jpg) and for a background image (something you see when you look at the image in a normal way).
### Example
Run the main file:

```Test.m```
